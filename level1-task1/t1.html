                <li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by technology, particularly computers. AI has specific applications such as expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision.</li>
                <li>AI systems function by absorbing massive volumes of labeled training data, analyzing it for correlations and patterns, and then using these patterns to forecast future states.</li>
                <li>AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include</li>
                <li>AI is significant because of its potential to revolutionize how we live, work, and play. It has been successfully employed in business to automate functions previously performed by humans, such as customer service, lead creation, fraud detection, and quality control.</li>
                <li>Subsets of AI technology are machine learning,deep learning,natural language processing,nureal network,robotics,genetic algorithm</li>
