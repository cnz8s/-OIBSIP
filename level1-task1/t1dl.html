                <li>Deep Learning is an area of machine learning that makes use of neural networks to model and solve complicated problems.</li>
                <li> Neural networks are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes that analyze and alter input.</li>
                <li>Deep Learning's defining feature is the utilization of deep neural networks, which comprise numerous layers of interconnected nodes. These networks may learn complicated representations of data by detecting hierarchical patterns and characteristics in the data.</li>
                <li>Deep Learning systems can learn and develop automatically from data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.</li>
                <li>Deep neural networks are often trained using a significant quantity of data and computer resources. However, the availability of cloud computing and the development of specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), have made deep neural networks easier to train.
